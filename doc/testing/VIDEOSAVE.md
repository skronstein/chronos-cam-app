Video Recording Tests
=====================
These tests attempt to validate the performance and feature set of the video encoder system,
including tolerance of low-quality media and use of the advanced encoding formats. These tests
begin after the user has recorded a scene capturing some visible activity. Unless otherwise
specified, recordings should be taken at 1280x1024 and a speed of 1057fps.

H.264 Feature Tests
-------------------
1. From the payback window, select an approximately 360-frame region of the video to be recorded
    using the "Mark Start" and "Mark End" buttons, then tap the Settings button to open the save
    settings window.
2. Set the save format to "H.264" and set the framerate to 60fps.
    * The default quality should be set to 0.7 bits per pixel and 40Mbps.
    * The text should read "40.00Mbps @ 1280x1024 60fps".
3. Tap the down arrows in the bits per pixel box to decrease the quality settings.
    * The bpp should decrese in steps of 0.1, down to a value of zero.
    * The text should read "40.00Mbps" until a value of 0.5bpp is reached, and then
        decrease linearly with the bpp setting.
4. Select a value of 0.3bpp, and then tap the up and down arrows of the "max bitrate" box to adjust the bitrate limit.
    * When the maximum bitrate exceeds 23.59Mbps, the text should read "23.59Mbps @ 1280x1024 60fps"
    * When the maximum bitrate is less than 23.59Mbps, the text should display the selected maximum.
    * The maximum bitrate should be limited to 60Mbps.
5. Select a maximum bitrate of 20Mbps, and then tap the up and down arrows "saved file framerate" box to adjust the framerate.
    * When the framerate reaches 50fps, the text should display "19.66Mbps @ 1280x1024 50fps"
    * When the framerate is decreased bewlow 50fps, the displayed framerate should scale down linearly with fps.
6. Select a framerate of 30fps.
    * The text should now display "11.80Mbps @ 1280x1024 30fps"
7. Tap the "close" button to exit the save settings window, and then hit "Save" to record the
    selected video to the storage device.
8. Remove the storage device from the camera, and insert it into a laptop for review.
    * The video file should play smoothly with no artifacts or frame tearing.
    * The video file should play back at 30fps.
    * The video file should be approximately 17.6MB in size.
    * The video file metadata should list a bitrate of approximately 11.8Mbps.

H.264 Throttling Tests
----------------------
1. From the playback window, select a video region of interest of approximately 2000 frames to be recorded
    using the "Mark Start" and "Mark End" buttons, then tap the Settings button to open the save settings
    window.
2. Insert a slow media device such as a non-class 10 SD card, or a cheap USB 2.0 memory stick (recommend the
    16GB Verbatim Store-N-Go with artsy drawings on it).
3. Configure the encoder as follows:
    * H.264 save format
    * 2.00 bits per pixel
    * 60fps saved file framerate
    * 60Mbps maximum bitrate
4. Log into the camera via SSH using the command `ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@192.168.12.1`
5. Tap the "Close" button to exit the save settings window, and then tap the "Save" button to start saving.
    * The play rate should fluctuate as the video is being recorded, with an average value of 30-40fps.
6. While saving is in progress, execute the command `dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/sda1/zero.bin bs=4k` over SSH.
    * This should saturate the SD card with memory writes causing the saved frame rate to drop significantly or stop altogether.
    * The play rate may become jerky and inconsistent.
7. After a few seconds, hit `Ctrl-C` to terminate the `dd` command.
    * Video recording should return to normal after roughly 30 seconds and then save as normal.
8. Wait for the recording to complete and then remove the storage device from the camera, and insert it into a laptop for review.
    * The video file should play smoothly with no dropped frames, compression artifacts or frame tearing.

Free Space Check
----------------
1. Ensure that the SD card has been formatted as FAT32 and has less than 4GB of free space before starting this test.
2. Log into the camera via SSH and calculate the free space on the SD card using the command 'df /media/mmcblk1p1/'.
This will list the available space on the SD card in 1kiB blocks. Take this number and compute the maximum file size
in frames from the formula `frames = blocks / 2560`
3. Record a scene at a resolution of 1280x1024, capturing at least 2000 frames, and use the Mark Start and Mark End
buttons to select a region equal to the calculated number of frames plus one. For example, if the available 1kiB
blocks were 1000000, we would select a Mark Start position of 1, and a Mark End of 391.
4. Tap the 'Settings' button to open the Save settings window. Select "Raw 16bit" as the save format and tap
the close button to exit the save settings window. This should yeild a file size that just barely exceeds the free
space left on the filesystem.
