Simple Payback Test
-------------------
This test should immediately proceed after a recording test. For the all of these steps, whenever the
playback window is open, the video should appear smooth and glitch free. If the footage was recorded with
focus peaking and exposure aids (zebra stripes) enabled, the video should not contain any focus peaking
pixels or zebra striping. The position of the playback slider should always match the displayed frame
number and the relative position within the recorded video.

1. Tap the "Play" button to open the playback window.
    * The video should now show the start of your recorded video.
    * The play rate should be set to 60fps.
    * The frame number should be set to 1.
    * The mark in position should be set to the first frame.
    * The mark out position should be set to the last frame.
2. Rotate the jog wheel left and right to seek through the live video.
    * Turning the jog wheel to the right should advance the video one frame for each tick of the wheel.
    * Turning the jog wheel to the left should rewind the video one frame for each tick of the wheel.
    * Pressing the jog wheel and turning it right should advance the video ten frames for each tick.
    * Pressing the jog wheel and turning it left should rewind the video ten frames for each tick.
3. Pressing and holding the left and right play arrows should play and rewind the video at the speed
  given by the play rate.
4. Tapping the up and down arrows changes the play rate by either doubling of halving the rate.
    * The maximum play rate should be limited to 960fps.
    * The minimum play rate should be limited to 4.6fps.
    * The higher the play rate, the faster the recorded scene should be when played back with the left and right arrows.
5. Dragging the slider up and down should seek through the recorded video.
    * Dragging the slider to the top will seek to the end of video.
    * Dragging the slider to the bottom will seek to the start of video.
6. Drag the slider close to the start of video and press the left arrow to begin rewinding.
    * When the start of video is reached, the video should wrap around to the end of the video.
7. Rotate the jog wheel to the right to play forward.
    * When the end of video is reached, the video should wrap around to the start of video.

Simple Saving Test
------------------
This test should immediately proceed after a playback test, with an recorded scene that containns some
recognizable action or motion. This test should begin from the playback window with no removable media
present.

2. Tap the up and down arrows to select a playback rate of 120 fps.
3. Press and hold the right arrow button for 3 seconds to play through approximately 360 frames of footage.
4. Tap the Mark End button.
    * The current frame number should be roughly 360 frames greater than the mark start position.
    * The red line at the side of the playback slider should end at the current position of the slider.
    * The mark end frame should match the current frame number.
5. Tap the "Settings" button to open the save settings window.
    * The default format should be set to "H.264" at 60fps with a quality of 0.7 bits per pixel.
    * The H.264 profile dropdown menu should be disabled, with a value of "High"
    * The H.264 level dropwdown menu should be disabled, with a value of "Level 51"

8. Hit the "Save" button to begin recording the file to the USB memory stick.
    * The displayed video should go back, and a text overlay reading "Saving..." should appear.
    * The playback position will seek to the Mark start position and begin playing forward.
    * The play rate display should update in realtime to show the recording throughput.
    * The Save button should change its text to read "Abort Save", and all other buttons become disabled.
9. When the video reaches the "mark end", the recording should end and return to playback mode.
    * The text overlay should disappear and the display should return to the saved video.
    * The Abort Save button should change its text to read "Save"
    * All buttons should become active again.
10. As soon as the text overlay disappears, remove the USB memory stick and insert it into a laptop for review.

    * The saved file should have a name of the form "vid_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp4", displaying the time at which
        the file was saved (this may differ from when the video was recorded).
    * When opened with a video player, the video should match the selected exceprt on the camera.
    * The video should play smoothly from start to end without any dropped frames, encoding artifacts, or torn frames.
    * No artifacts of focus peaking or exposure aids should be present.
11. Examine the video metadata, which should should show:
    * Dimensions: 1280x1024
    * Codec: H.264 High Profile
    * Framerate: 60 frames per second
